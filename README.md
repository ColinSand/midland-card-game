# Migos 5 Card Draw

This is the final group project for [Midland Code Academy](https://cgps.midlandu.edu/academics/professional-studies/code-academy/) Cohort 8.

## About this Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and utilizes these packages:

### `socket-io` and `socket.io-client`

These packackages make it possible for multiple players to engage in game play and enjoy live chat functionality

### `passport`, `jsonwebtoken`, `cookie-parser`, `bcrypt` and `uuid`

These work together to provide user authentication and access to game play.

### `mysql`, `express` and `axios`

Put them together and you get the needed communication between the backend, frontend and the database

## Deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)
