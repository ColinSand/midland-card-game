        Writing code might be addictive. Empty files can be daunting, but
        filling them with working code and seeing a product that functions and
        can be used by others is absolutely thrilling. My arms still shoot into
        the air in celebration every time. Outside of coding I enjoy building
        and restoring almost anything, getting into the mountains or at least
        into a quiet forested area (Omaha’s not exactly famous for it’s
        mountains), and diving deep into conversation with friends about life
        and living well. Through everything, I get to be husband to an
        incredible woman who loves me far better than I deserve, and I get to be
        dad to two super interesting and fun kids who somehow manage to keep me
        young and turn my hair gray at the same time. Always love and always
        learn.

        My hobbies are watching and playing sports, playing video games and
        hunting! But the problem solving and thought process that goes into web
        development has brought me into pursuing a career in Software
        Engineering and also making coding one of my new found hobbies.
